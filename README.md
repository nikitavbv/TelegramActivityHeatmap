# Telegram Activity Heatmap

*Note: this is work in progress tool. It does not work as expected yet*

The aim of this tool is to monitor telegram activity of users and display it as heatmap. General online activity is monitored (not messaging activity), that's why client API (Telethon) is used here instead of bot API.

Example use case for this tool is to find a point of time when most chat members are online to make an important announcement.
